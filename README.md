# Criss-Cross Multi-Step Word Guessing Game

The goal of the game is for the player to guess words through a series of guesses of "sub-words". The player will be given a different number of guesses (with different sub-words to guess), depending on the difficulty selection.

FIXED DIFFICULTY
Each vowel guessed in the correct position gets 14 points. Each consonant guessed in the correct position gets 12 points. Each letter guessed correctly but in the wrong position within the substring gets 5 points. You can assume that the words do not contain repeated letters and all guesses are lowercase letters.

ARBITRARY DIFFICULTY
Similar to Fixed Difficulty but the word count is random.

GAME RULES
You have to guess letters in place of the asterisks.
Each vowel guessed in the correct position gets 14 points.
Each consonant guessed in the correct position gets 12 points.
Each letter guessed correctly but in the wrong position gets 5 points
If the true letters were "dog, say, and you guessed "hod',
you would score 14 points for guessing the vowel "o", in the correct position and 5 points for guessing "d" correctly but in the incorrect position. Your score would therefore be 19.

If you guessed the correct word at the end of the game, you win!
